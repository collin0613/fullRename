This program works as intended with a CSV file in the same directory as the source folder with the files intended to be renamed.
The CSV will have a caseNumber and trackNumber stat for each file, and the program takes the chronologically first file and renames it to the 
corresponding case number of the chronologically first occuring track number in the CSV. The paths included in the script are changed for 
real-world use to the right path names on the employer's computer.
